# Cricket Scorebooks

Cricket scorebooks for Junior and Senior cricket. Specifically, scoresheets are provided that we have found to be suitable for the Cricket Australia Level 1 and Level 2 formats, as well as Levels 3, 4 and senior cricket which all share the same format.

I have generated these scoresheets based on many years of scoring cricket at all levels; they are the original work of Matthew van de Werken. They are hereby released to the public under a Creative Commons share and share alike licence.

## Instructions for making a scorebook

For the Level 3, 4 and Senior score book you will need to download LibreOffice from the web, as MS Word doesn't handle odt files perfectly.

To generate a scorebook, create a cover page (it can be blank, but I've found a graphic with sponsors and the club logo works well).

Download the indemnity form to put at the front of the book; this is optional and note that I have not had it checked by a lawyer so its legal status is uncertain.

Download the scoresheet for the grade you want a score book for.

Open each page in the appropriate editor (MS Word or LibreOffice), change the logo to your club logo or whatever you choose, and create a pdf using that program's menu.

Use a pdf editor to concatenate the cover page, indemnity form and 40-50 copies of the scoresheet for your book.

Take the resulting single PDF to your local print shop (OfficeWorks, Snap Printing, etc), and have them print it, put a heavy backing sheet on, and spiral bind it. I've found it's more cost effective to only have the cover page in full colour, otherwise the expense is prohibitive.

If you want to make a custom scoresheet, I've kept all the parts for the page in the "Parts" directory; from there you can create your own custom page using LibreOffice. Note that it can be a bit fiddly to have all the parts line up nicely, and it tends to do a little push-and-shove dance so trial and error with frequent saves is  the method I've foud works best.

Good luck, and enjoy!
